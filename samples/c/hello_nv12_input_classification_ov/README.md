# Hello NV12 Input Classification C Sample for OpenVINOâ„¢ 2.0 C-API

This sample demonstrates how to execute an inference of image classification networks like AlexNet with images in NV12 color format using Synchronous Inference Request API.

## How It Works

At startup, the sample application reads command-line parameters, loads specified network and an
image in the `NV12` color format to OpenVINO Runtime. Then, the sample creates a synchronous inference request object. When inference is done, the
application outputs data to the standard output stream.

For more information, refer to the ["Integrate OpenVINO Runtime with Your Application" Guide](../../../docs/OV_Runtime_UG/integrate_with_your_application.md).

## Building

To build the sample, use the instructions available in the **Build the Sample Applications** section in [OpenVINO Toolkit Samples](../../../docs/OV_Runtime_UG/Samples_Overview.md).

## Running

To run the sample, you need to specify a model and an image:

- You may use [public](@ref omz_models_group_public) or [Intel's](@ref omz_models_group_intel) pre-trained models from the Open Model Zoo. The models can be downloaded using the [Model Downloader](@ref omz_tools_downloader).
- You may use images from the media files collection, available online in the [test data](https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/data/test_data).

The sample accepts an uncompressed image in the `NV12` color format. To run the sample, you need to
convert your `BGR`/`RGB` image to `NV12`. To do this, you can use one of the widely available tools such
as FFmpeg or GStreamer. The following command shows how to convert an ordinary image into an
uncompressed `NV12` image, using FFmpeg:

```sh
ffmpeg -i cat.jpg -pix_fmt nv12 cat.yuv
```

> **NOTES**:
>
> - Since the sample reads raw image files, you should provide a correct image size along with the
>   image path. The sample expects the logical size of the image, not the buffer size. For example,
>   for 640x480 BGR/RGB image the corresponding `NV12` logical image size is also 640x480, whereas the
>   buffer size is 640x720.
> - By default, this sample expects that network input has the `BGR` channel order. If you trained your
>   model to work with `RGB`, you need to reconvert your model, using Model Optimizer 
>   with `--reverse_input_channels` argument specified. For more information about the argument,
>   refer to **When to Reverse Input Channels** section of
>   [Embedding Preprocessing Computation](../../../docs/MO_DG/prepare_model/Additional_Optimizations.md).
> - Before running the sample with a trained model, make sure the model is converted to the OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (\*.xml + \*.bin) by using [Model Optimizer](../../../docs/MO_DG/Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.md).
>
> - The sample accepts models in the ONNX format (\*.onnx) that do not require preprocessing.

### Example
1. Download a pre-trained model, using [Model Downloader](@ref omz_tools_downloader):
```
python <path_to_omz_tools>/downloader.py --name alexnet
```

2. If a model is not in the OpenVINO IR or ONNX format, it must be converted with Model Converter:

```
python <path_to_omz_tools>/converter.py --name alexnet
```

3. Do inference of `NV12` image, using the `alexnet` model on `CPU`, for example:

```
<path_to_sample>/hello_nv12_input_classification_ov_c <path_to_model>/alexnet.xml <path_to_image>/cat.yuv 300x300 CPU
```

## Sample Output

The application outputs top-10 inference results.
