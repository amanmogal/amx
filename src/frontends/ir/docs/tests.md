# OpenVINO IR Frontend tests

OpenVINO IR tests covers the next frontend functionality: parser IRs, read model from the memory, extensions support.

## How to build and run tests

CMake target `ov_ir_frontend_tests` is responsible for building IR tests. IR Frontend tests uses `gtest` framework for tests execution.

After the build `ov_ir_frontend_tests` (`ov_ir_frontend_tests.exe` for Windows) binary files can be used to run all tests for the IR frontend.
