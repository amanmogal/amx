# How to Write Unite Test for C API

To ensure the accuracy of C API, all interfaces need to implement function level unite test at least. According to the object define, all implemented unite test cases are located in this folder.

If developer wrap new interfaces from OpenVINO C++, you also need to add the unite test case in the correct location.
Here is an example wrap C++ interface to C [wrap core](./how_to_wrap_openvino_interfaces_with_c.md).

Create unite test case for this interface. At first, this interface is for core operation so the location should at [ov_core_test.cpp](../tests/ov_core_test.cpp). Also, the interface has default parameter so need to make unite test case for parameter missing. The final based function level test like:
