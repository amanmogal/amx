Debug capabilities are the set of useful debug features, most of them are controlled by environment variables.

They can be activated at runtime and might be used for analyzing issues, getting more context, comparing execution results, etc.

Use the following cmake option to enable snippets debug capabilities:

`-DENABLE_DEBUG_CAPS=ON`
