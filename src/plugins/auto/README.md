# OpenVINO AUTO Plugin

AUTO plugin for OpenVINO™ Runtime, uses a “virtual” or a “proxy” device, which does not bind to a specific type of hardware, but rather selects the processing unit for inference automatically. It detects available devices, picks the best-suited for the task, and configures optimization settings. This way, developer can write the application once and deploy it anywhere.
