# OpenVINO Core debug capabilities

OpenVINO Core contains a set of different debug capabilities which allow making developer life a little bit easier, because these capabilities support to collect information about object statuses in the process of OpenVINO Runtime execution and report this information to developer.

* OpenVINO Model debug capabilities are described in the [OpenVINO Model User Guide](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_OV_UG_Model_Representation.html#model-debug-capabilities).
