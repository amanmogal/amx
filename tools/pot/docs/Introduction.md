## Introduction
Post-training quantization is a model compression technique where the values in a neural network are converted from a 32-bit or 16-bit format to an 8-bit integer format after the network has been fine-tuned on a training dataset. This helps to reduce the model’s latency by taking advantage of computationally efficient 8-bit integer arithmetic. It also reduces the model's size and memory footprint. 

Post-training quantization is easy to implement and is a quick way to boost model performance. It only requires a representative dataset, and it can be performed using the Post-training Optimization Tool (POT) in OpenVINO. POT is distributed as part of the [OpenVINO Development Tools](@ref openvino_docs_install_guides_install_dev_tools) package. To apply post-training quantization with POT, you need:

* A floating-point precision model, FP32 or FP16, converted into the OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) format.
* A representative dataset (annotated or unannotated) of around 300 samples that depict typical use cases or scenarios.
* (Optional) An annotated validation dataset that can be used for checking the model’s accuracy.

The post-training quantization algorithm takes samples from the representative dataset, inputs them into the network, and calibrates the network based on the resulting weights and activation values. Once calibration is complete, values in the network are converted to 8-bit integer format.

While post-training quantization makes your model run faster and take less memory, it may cause a slight reduction in accuracy. If you performed post-training quantization on your model and find that it isn’t accurate enough, try using [Quantization-aware Training](@ref qat_introduction) to increase its accuracy.


### Post-Training Quantization Quick Start Examples
Try out these interactive Jupyter Notebook examples to learn the POT API and see post-training quantization in action:

* [Quantization of Image Classification Models with POT](https://docs.openvino.ai/2022.2/notebooks/113-image-classification-quantization-with-output.html).

## Quantizing Models with POT
The figure below shows the post-training quantization workflow with POT. In a typical workflow, a pre-trained model is converted to OpenVINO IR format using Model Optimizer. Then, the model is quantized with a representative dataset using POT.

### Post-training Quantization Methods
Depending on your needs and requirements, POT provides two quantization methods that can be used: Default Quantization and Accuracy-aware Quantization.

#### Default Quantization
Default Quantization uses an unannotated dataset to perform quantization. It uses representative dataset items to estimate the range of activation values in a network and then quantizes the network. This method is recommended to start with, because it results in a fast and accurate model in most cases. To quantize your model with Default Quantization, see the [Quantizing Models](@ref pot_default_quantization_usage) page.

#### Accuracy-aware Quantization
Accuracy-aware Quantization is an advanced method that maintains model accuracy within a predefined range by leaving some network layers unquantized. It uses a trade-off between speed and accuracy to meet user-specified requirements. This method requires an annotated dataset and may require more time for quantization. To quantize your model with Accuracy-aware Quantization, see the [Quantizing Models with Accuracy Control](@ref pot_accuracyaware_usage) page.

### Quantization Best Practices and FAQs
If you quantized your model and it isn’t accurate enough, visit the [Quantization Best Practices](@ref pot_docs_BestPractices) page for tips on improving quantized performance. Sometimes, older Intel CPU generations can encounter a saturation issue when running quantized models that can cause reduced accuracy: learn more on the [Saturation Issue Workaround](@ref pot_saturation_issue) page.
