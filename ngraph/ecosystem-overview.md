# Framework & runtime support

One of nGraphâ€™s key features is framework neutrality. We currently support 
popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and MXNet with stable 
bridges to pass computational graphs to nGraph. Additionally nGraph 
Compiler has a functional bridge to PaddlePaddle. 
For these frameworks, we have successfully tested functionality with a few 
deep learning workloads, and we plan to bring stable support for them in the 
upcoming releases. 

To further promote framework neutrality, the nGraph team has been actively 
contributing to the ONNX project. Developers who already have a "trained" 
DNN (Deep Neural Network) model can use nGraph to bypass significant 
framework-based complexity and [import it] to test or run on targeted and 
efficient backends with our user-friendly Python-based API.

nGraph is also integrated as an execution provider for [ONNX Runtime], 
which is the first publicly available inference engine for ONNX.

The table below summarizes our current progress on supported frameworks. 
If you are an architect of a framework wishing to take advantage of speed 
and multi-device support of nGraph Compiler, please refer to [Framework integration guide] section.
