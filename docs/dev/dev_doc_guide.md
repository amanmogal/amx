# How to develop developer documentation

The developer documentation is needed to provide basic information about component development.
This guide contains requirements which are applied for component developer documentation.


## The component structure

The OpenVINO component structure is fully defined in the [dedicated section of developer documentation](./index.md#openvino-component-structure),
this guide is more concentrated on parts which are used for developer documentation, the structure you can find below:

```
openvino_component/
    docs/               // Contains detailed component documentation
    README.md           // Endtry point for the developer documentation
```
