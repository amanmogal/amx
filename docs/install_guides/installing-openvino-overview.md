    This is not the most recent release of OpenVINO. Since it is not a Long-term-support
    version either, the selector tool for it is no longer available.

   The OpenVINO Development Tools is still available for older versions of OpenVINO,
   as well as the current one, from the GitHub repository and PyPI. :doc:`Learn more <openvino_docs_install_guides_install_dev_tools>`.
