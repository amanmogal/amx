# OpenVINO™ Ecosystem Overview {#openvino_ecosystem}


OpenVINO™ is not just one tool. It is part of an expansive ecosystem of utilities, frameworks, addons, etc. They all provide a comprehensive workflow for developing deep learning solutions. Learn more about each of them to reach the full potential of OpenVINO™.

### OpenVINO™ Model Server (OVMS)	   
OpenVINO Model Server is a scalable, high-performance solution for serving deep learning models optimized for Intel® architectures. The server uses Inference Engine libraries as a backend and exposes gRPC and HTTP/REST interfaces for inference that are fully compatible with TensorFlow Serving.

### Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF)
A suite of advanced algorithms for Neural Network inference optimization with minimal accuracy drop. NNCF applies quantization, filter pruning, binarization and sparsity algorithms to PyTorch and TensorFlow models during training.

### OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow (OVTF)
A solution empowering TensorFlow developers with OpenVINO's optimization capabilities. With just two lines of code your application, you can offload inference to OpenVINO, while keeping the TensorFlow API.

* [installation Guide on GitHub](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/dlstreamer_gst/wiki/Install-Guide)

### DL Workbench
An alternative, web-based version of OpenVINO designed to make production of pre-trained deep learning models significantly easier. Its feature set differs slightly from that of its older, command-line interface brother. The easiest way to see how it works is to use [Intel® DevCloud for the Edge](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/devcloud.html).
