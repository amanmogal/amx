  :description: Explore the examples of operation instances expressed as IR
                XML snippets in the opset15 operation set, supported in OpenVINO™
                toolkit.

This specification document describes the ``opset15`` operation set supported in OpenVINO™.
Support for each particular operation from the list below depends on the capabilities of an inference plugin
and may vary among different hardware platforms and devices. Examples of operation instances are provided as IR xml
snippets. Such IR is generated by the Model Optimizer. The semantics match corresponding OpenVINO operation classes
declared in ``namespace opset15``.
