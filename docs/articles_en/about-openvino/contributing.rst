##########################################

Before you start a contribution, check if the change has not been implemented already.
If it happens to be in progress, align with the developer to work cooperatively.
Remember to build OpenVINO, using the latest master branch and verify that your
changes are still applicable. Do not address issues that only affect older non-LTS
releases, like 2022.2. For more information, refer to the
:doc:`Release Policy <./release-notes-openvino/release-policy>`.
