`create a new issue <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues>`__
in the GitHub issue tracker.

.. rubric:: Propose new features / improvements
   :name: propose-new-features

If you want to share your ideas for improving OpenVINO, you can open a new
`GitHub Discussion <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/discussions>`__.

`Feature Request Issue <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=enhancement%2Cfeature&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFeature+Request%5D%3A+>`__
In any case, you need to provide a detailed description, including use cases, benefits,
and potential challenges.


:fas:`code-branch` Contribute code changes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First of all, always start by checking if the change has not been implemented before!
Build OpenVINO, using the latest master branch and verify that your changes are still
applicable. If somebody else is already working on it, you may still help, having
aligned with the other developer. Also, do not address issues that only affect older
non-LTS releases, like 2022.2. For more information, refer to the
:doc:`Release Policy <./release-notes-openvino/release-policy>`.

.. rubric:: Fix bugs
   :name: fix-bugs

If you want to help improving OpenVINO, choose one of the issues reported in
`GitHub Issue Tracker <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues>`__ and
`create a Pull Request <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_PR.md>`__
addressing it. Consider one of the tasks listed as
`first-time contributions <https://github.com/orgs/openvinotoolkit/projects/3>`__.

.. rubric:: Develop new features
   :name: develop-new-features

If the feature you want to develop is more complex or not well defined yet,
you may want to `discuss it <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/discussions>`__
with OpenVINO developers first.

.. rubric:: Develop a new device plugin
   :name: develop-new-device-plugin

Since the market of computing devices is constantly evolving, OpenVINO is always open
to extending its support for new hardware. If you want to run inference on a device that
is currently not supported, you can see how to develop a new plugin for it in the
`Plugin Developer Guide <https://docs.openvino.ai/nightly/documentation/openvino-extensibility/openvino-plugin-library.html>`__.


:fas:`file-alt` Improve documentation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The easiest way to help with documentation is to review it and provide feedback on the
existing articles. Whether you notice a mistake, see the possibility of improving the text,
or think more information should be added, you can reach out to any of the `documentation
maintainers <https://github.com/orgs/openvinotoolkit/teams/openvino-docs-maintainers>`__ to discuss the potential changes.
You can also edit the articles directly on GitHub or open them with
`Github.dev <https://github.dev/openvinotoolkit/openvino>`__. Do not forget to create
a **Pull Request**, following the `guidelines <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_DOCS.md>`__.

.. rubric:: Review user documentation
   :name: user-documentation

The documentation is built from several sources, mainly
`docs <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/docs>`__ folder,
using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__ and the
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`__
markup language. It is published at `docs.openvino.ai <https://docs.openvino.ai/>`__,
which is recommended for reading the articles.

.. rubric:: Check OpenVINO developer documentation
   :name: openvino-developer-documentation

The documentation is contained entirely in the
`docs/dev <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/docs/dev>`__ folder.


:fas:`bullhorn` Promote and support OpenVINO
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. rubric:: Popularize OpenVINO
   :name: popularize-openvino

Articles, tutorials, blog posts, demos, videos, and any other involvement in the OpenVINO
community is more than welcome. If you discuss or present OpenVINO on various social platforms,
you are raising awareness of the product among A.I. enthusiasts and enabling other people
to discover the toolkit. Feel free to reach out to OpenVINO developers if you need help
with making a contribution.

.. rubric:: Help other community members
